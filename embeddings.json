These reporting errors will be counted as an error in the review process and may cause service intensity add-on (SIA) payments to be applied incorrectly on the claim. Hospices shall report visits and length of visits (rounded to the nearest 15-minute increment), for nurses, aides, social workers and therapists who are employed by the hospice, that occur on the date of death, after the patient has passed away, with modifier PM. The reporting of post-mortem visits, on the date of death, should occur regardless of the patient s level of care or site of service. Post-mortem visits occurring on a date subsequent to the date of death are not to be reported. Date of death is defined as the date of death reported on the death certificate. Hospices shall report hospice visits that occur before death on a separate line from those which occur after death. For example, assume that a nurse arrives at the home at 9 p.m. to provide routine home care (RHC) to a dying patient, and that the patient passes away at 11 p.m. The nurse stays with the family until 1:30 a.m. The hospice should report a nursing visit with eight 15-minute time units for the visit from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. On a separate line, the hospice should report a nursing visit with a PM modifier with four 15-minute time units for the portion of the visit from 11 p.m. to midnight to account for the 1 hour post mortem visit. If the patient passes away suddenly, and the hospice nurse does not arrive until after his death at 11 p.m., and remains with the family until 1:30 a.m., then the hospice should report a line item nursing visit with a PM modifier and four 15-minute increments of time as the units to account for the 1 hour post mortem visit from 11 p.m. to midnight.

      "content": "What is an overlap? An overlap is when an incorrect claim submitted by the same or a different provider is processed and posted to the common working file (CWF), resulting in claim overlap rejection(s) of subsequent claim(s). When more than one provider is involved, the providers must work together to resolve the error. Some overlapping claim examples include: Same provider dates of service overlap Charges that should have been combined on one claim Outpatient claim submitted before allowing time for inpatient claim(s) to finalize Claims that should have been submitted in service date sequence Different provider dates of service overlap Did not report a leave of absence on the claim Services subject to consolidated billing Incorrect patient status code was submitted Last Reviewed: 03/27/2025 Why is my claim overlapping another facility s when my dates do not fall within their dates of service? The facility with the claim for the earliest dates of service may have billed an incorrect patient discharge status code. Applying the correct patient status code will help assure that the facilities receive prompt and correct payment. If your patient status code is incorrect, it can indicate a patient is still in your facility when, in fact, they were discharged and admitted to another facility. It is recommended that you submit an adjustment to update the patient status on your claim. If the other facility has submitted an incorrect patient status code, it is recommended that you contact the other facility and ask them to update the patient status code on the claim Example The claim indicates that the patient is still in your facility (patient status 30), but the patient was transferred to a Medicare certified skilled nursing facility (SNF) (patient status 03). Resource: CMS internet-only-manual (IOM), 100-04, Chapter 25 (PDF) Last Reviewed: 03/27/2025 What steps can be taken to identify claims that overlap with another provider?

What steps can be taken to get the other facility s claim updated? While providers/facilities are required and expected to work together to resolve a billing issue, providers may occasionally require assistance from the Medicare Administrator Contractor (MAC). In that case, Palmetto GBA will work with both providers/facilities for resolution. In addition, Palmetto GBA will work with other Medicare administrative contractors (MACs) when the overlapping claim is processed by another MAC. Complete and submit \"Billing Dispute Resolution Request Form.\" Last Reviewed: 03/27/2025 I contacted the SNF and asked them to update the patient status on their claim, but they stated that the patient s benefits are exhausted, and that they are not responsible for paying the services. What should I do? You must determine if the services were provided during the covered period of the SNF Part A stay or after the benefits exhausted, since consolidated billing rules may or may not apply. The SNF is required to bill \"benefits exhaust\" and/or \"no pay\" claims until the patient is discharged from the facility. In order to bypass Medicare edits, refile your corrected claim after the SNF has submitted or corrected their claims. In addition, it is recommended that you work with the SNF to help determine if the patient s services were provided during the covered or non-covered portion of the stay and for claims resolution since timely filing rules apply. Scenarios Services were provided during the SNF covered Part A stay SNF consolidated billing rules apply Services were provided after the benefits exhausted SNF is only responsible for billing physical, occupational and speech therapy services All other services may be billed directly to the Medicare administrative contractor (MAC) Services were provided after the patient was discharged All services may be billed directly to the MAC Benefits Exhaust The SNF is only responsible for billing physical, occupational, and speech therapy services received during a non-covered stay. The beneficiary s non-covered stay may be due to Part A benefits being exhausted, post hospital stay or the beneficiary did not meet SNF level of care requirements. SNF Consolidated Billing The consolidated billing requirements confer on the SNF s billing responsibility for the entire package of care a resident receives during a covered Part A SNF stay. The SNF must submit Medicare claims for all services rendered to their residents under a covered Part A SNF stay, except for certain excluded/separately payable services. Refer to the CMS SNF Consolidated Billing for a list of excluded/separately payable services: [CCYY] Part A MAC Update Downloads [CCYY] Part B MAC Update Downloads The SNF must either furnish the service directly with their own resources or obtain the service from an outside entity (such as a supplier) under an arrangement. Under such arrangement, the SNF must reimburse the outside entity for those Medicare covered services subject to consolidated billing Refer to the CMS SNF PPS Best Practices Guidelines for sample agreements if you need to establish payment arrangements with the SNF Note: Absence of a valid arrangement does not invalidate the SNF s responsibility to reimburse suppliers for services included in the SNF stay.

How can I resolve this? Claims for inpatient hospital and skilled nursing facility (SNF) services have priority over claims for home health services, as beneficiaries cannot receive home care while they are institutionalized. Beneficiaries cannot be institutionalized and receive home care simultaneously. Verify dates of service on your claim If dates of service are incorrect, correct your claim and resubmit If dates of service are correct, it is recommended that you contact the home health agency and ask them to correct their claim Edit exclusions: The inpatient claim admission date is the same as the HHA transfer/discharge date The inpatient claim discharge date is the same as the home health agency admission date The inpatient claim dates are between the occurrence span code 74 \"From\" date and the day following the occurrence span code \"Through\" date Resource: CMS IOM, 100-04, Chapter 10 (PDF), section 30.9, and Chapter 25 (PDF). Last Reviewed: 03/27/2025 How do I bill my claims when a patient revokes or elects hospice coverage during his/her inpatient stay? Electing or revoking the Medicare hospice benefit is the beneficiary s choice. The patient or his/her representative may elect or revoke Medicare hospice care at any time in writing. The hospice cannot revoke the beneficiary s election, nor request or demand that the patient revoke his/her election. If the patient revokes his/her hospice election, Medicare coverage of all benefits waived when hospice care was initially elected resumes under the traditional Medicare program. The information below provides a general guidance on how to submit claims. When a beneficiary elects hospice during an inpatient stay: Bill traditional Medicare for period before hospice election Patient status code is 51 (discharge to hospice medical facility) Discharge date is the effective date of hospice election Bill hospice for period of care after hospice election When a patient revokes hospice during an inpatient stay: Bill hospice for period up to hospice revocation Bill traditional Medicare for period after hospice revocation Admission date is same as the hospice revocation date Statement from date is the same as the hospice revocation date See C7010 Claim Submission Error Help article for more information.

Should I bill the hospice, traditional Medicare, or the MA plan? Federal regulations require that Medicare administrative contractors (MAC) maintain payment responsibility for managed care enrollees who elect hospice. While a hospice election is in effect, certain types of claims may be submitted to the MAC by either the hospice provider or a provider treating an illness not related to the terminal condition. These claims are subject to the usual Medicare rules of payment, but only for the following services: Hospice services covered under the Medicare hospice benefit are billed by the Medicare hospice Institutional providers may submit claims to Medicare with the condition code \"07\" when services provided are not related to the treatment of the terminal condition MA plan enrollees that elect hospice may revoke hospice election at any time, but claims will continue to be paid by the MAC as if the beneficiary were enrolled in Medicare until the first day of the month following when hospice election was revoked Example Beneficiary s hospice election period ended on 1/10/YY Bill the MAC for claims for dates of service 1/11/YY to 1/31/YY Bill the MA plan for claims for dates of service 2/1/YY and beyond Resource: CMS IOM 100-04, Chapter 11 (PDF), section 30.4, 50.

These rejections usually appear on the claim when the line item dates of service (LIDOS) are within the admission and discharge dates of another facility s claim. For example, reason code C7251 will appear as the claim denial when the LIDOS of an outpatient claim (e.g., 12X, 13X, 14X, 22X, 23X, 34X, 74X, 75X, 83X and 85X) overlaps with a Part A skilled nursing facility (SNF) inpatient claim (21X) or when the outpatient claim LIDOS overlaps with an inpatient Part B (22X) claim. Last Reviewed: 03/27/2025 My claim contains HCPCS code C9399 (Unclassified drugs or biologicals), and received reason code 32512 indicating that the associated units must be equal to one. Please explain this reason code. Reason code 32512 states, 'type of bill is equal to outpatient, pricing indicator = Y, HCPCS code C9399 is present but associated units are greater than one. Units must be equal to one.' HCPCS code C9399 should be used to report drugs and biologicals that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but that do not yet have a product-specific drug/biological HCPCS assigned. Per Change Request (CR) 3287, HCPCS code C9399 should be reported as follows: For the ANSI ASC X12N 837 I, hospital outpatient departments will report on type of bill (TOB) = 13x, containing revenue code 0636, HCPCS code C9399, and NDC number present in Loop 2400 LIN 03 of the 837 I The hospital may report in the 'Remarks' section of the CMS-1450 or its electronic equivalent the National Drug Code (NDC) for the drug, the quantity of the drug that was administered, the unit of measure applicable to the drug or biological, and the date the drug was furnished to the beneficiary When billing the applicable information for the unassigned drug on Page 2 in Direct Data Entry (DDE), providers should report one drug per revenue line. In addition, each occurrence of C9399 should be billed with a corresponding unit of one, regardless of the actual quantity of the drug that is administered. Examples: 1. Drug 'X' is approved by the FDA, but does not yet have a HCPCS code assigned. During the outpatient encounter on January 1, 2010, 5 units of the drug are administered.

The correct billing for drug screens, specifically HCPCS code G0431, should be billed per patient encounter and not for the number of drugs that are screened. HCPCS code G0431 may only be reported once per patient encounter. If a claim is submitted for the number of drugs screened instead of per patient encounter, the claim will deny. Last Reviewed: 03/27/2025 What is the timeframe for submitting a claim adjustment? Part A providers may adjust claims, for the purpose of correcting clerical errors, within one year from the initial determination or within four years when good cause is supported. While a contractor may choose to reopen a claim at any time under limited criteria, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) does not expect that a contractor would regularly grant reopening requests for older claims because its history may not be readily available. Both contractor and provider have a reasonable expectation to be timely in the administrative finality of their claims. Third party payer error in making primary payment does not constitute good cause for the purpose of reopening a claim beyond one year of the initial determination or redetermination. A contractor s decision to reopen or not to reopen a claim, regardless of the reason for that decision, is not subject to appeal. Adjustments to add services If a provider fails to include a particular item or service on its initial bill, an adjustment request to include such item(s) or service(s) is not permitted after the expiration of the time limitation for filing a claim. Hospital diagnosis related group (DRG) claim adjustments Hospital adjustments to correct the diagnostic and procedure coding on their claim to a higher weighted DRG must be submitted within 60 days of the paid remittance. Claim adjustments that result in a lower weighted DRG are not subject to the 60 days requirement. Skilled nursing facility (SNF) health insurance prospective payment system (HIPPS) code adjustments SNF adjustments to change a HIPPS code due to a minimum data set (MDS) correction must be completed within 120 days of the through date on the claim.

An overlap is when an incorrect claim submitted by the same or a different provider is processed and posted to the common working file (CWF), resulting in claim overlap rejection(s) of subsequent claim(s). When more than one provider is involved, the providers must work together to resolve the error. Some overlapping claim examples include: Same provider dates of service overlap Charges that should have been combined on one claim Outpatient claim submitted before allowing time for inpatient claim(s) to finalize Claims that should have been submitted in service date sequence Different provider dates of service overlap Did not report a leave of absence on the claim Services subject to consolidated billing Incorrect patient status code was submitted Last Reviewed: 03/27/2025 Why is my claim overlapping another facility s when my dates do not fall within their dates of service? The facility with the claim for the earliest dates of service may have billed an incorrect patient discharge status code. Applying the correct patient status code will help assure that the facilities receive prompt and correct payment. If your patient status code is incorrect, it can indicate a patient is still in your facility when, in fact, they were discharged and admitted to another facility. It is recommended that you submit an adjustment to update the patient status on your claim. If the other facility has submitted an incorrect patient status code, it is recommended that you contact the other facility and ask them to update the patient status code on the claim Example The claim indicates that the patient is still in your facility (patient status 30), but the patient was transferred to a Medicare certified skilled nursing facility (SNF) (patient status 03).

What steps can be taken to get the other facility s claim updated? While providers/facilities are required and expected to work together to resolve a billing issue, providers may occasionally require assistance from the Medicare Administrator Contractor (MAC). In that case, Palmetto GBA will work with both providers/facilities for resolution. In addition, Palmetto GBA will work with other Medicare administrative contractors (MACs) when the overlapping claim is processed by another MAC. Complete and submit \"Billing Dispute Resolution Request Form.\" Last Reviewed: 03/27/2025 I contacted the SNF and asked them to update the patient status on their claim, but they stated that the patient s benefits are exhausted, and that they are not responsible for paying the services. What should I do? You must determine if the services were provided during the covered period of the SNF Part A stay or after the benefits exhausted, since consolidated billing rules may or may not apply. The SNF is required to bill \"benefits exhaust\" and/or \"no pay\" claims until the patient is discharged from the facility. In order to bypass Medicare edits, refile your corrected claim after the SNF has submitted or corrected their claims. In addition, it is recommended that you work with the SNF to help determine if the patient s services were provided during the covered or non-covered portion of the stay and for claims resolution since timely filing rules apply. Scenarios Services were provided during the SNF covered Part A stay SNF consolidated billing rules apply Services were provided after the benefits exhausted SNF is only responsible for billing physical, occupational and speech therapy services All other services may be billed directly to the Medicare administrative contractor (MAC) Services were provided after the patient was discharged All services may be billed directly to the MAC Benefits Exhaust The SNF is only responsible for billing physical, occupational, and speech therapy services received during a non-covered stay. The beneficiary s non-covered stay may be due to Part A benefits being exhausted, post hospital stay or the beneficiary did not meet SNF level of care requirements. SNF Consolidated Billing The consolidated billing requirements confer on the SNF s billing responsibility for the entire package of care a resident receives during a covered Part A SNF stay. The SNF must submit Medicare claims for all services rendered to their residents under a covered Part A SNF stay, except for certain excluded/separately payable services. Refer to the CMS SNF Consolidated Billing for a list of excluded/separately payable services: [CCYY] Part A MAC Update Downloads [CCYY] Part B MAC Update Downloads The SNF must either furnish the service directly with their own resources or obtain the service from an outside entity (such as a supplier) under an arrangement. Under such arrangement, the SNF must reimburse the outside entity for those Medicare covered services subject to consolidated billing Refer to the CMS SNF PPS Best Practices Guidelines for sample agreements if you need to establish payment arrangements with the SNF Note: Absence of a valid arrangement does not invalidate the SNF s responsibility to reimburse suppliers for services included in the SNF stay.

How can I resolve this? Claims for inpatient hospital and skilled nursing facility (SNF) services have priority over claims for home health services, as beneficiaries cannot receive home care while they are institutionalized. Beneficiaries cannot be institutionalized and receive home care simultaneously.

Last Reviewed: 03/27/2025 How do I bill my claims when a patient revokes or elects hospice coverage during his/her inpatient stay? Electing or revoking the Medicare hospice benefit is the beneficiary s choice. The patient or his/her representative may elect or revoke Medicare hospice care at any time in writing. The hospice cannot revoke the beneficiary s election, nor request or demand that the patient revoke his/her election. If the patient revokes his/her hospice election, Medicare coverage of all benefits waived when hospice care was initially elected resumes under the traditional Medicare program. The information below provides a general guidance on how to submit claims. When a beneficiary elects hospice during an inpatient stay: Bill traditional Medicare for period before hospice election Patient status code is 51 (discharge to hospice medical facility) Discharge date is the effective date of hospice election Bill hospice for period of care after hospice election When a patient revokes hospice during an inpatient stay: Bill hospice for period up to hospice revocation Bill traditional Medicare for period after hospice revocation Admission date is same as the hospice revocation date Statement from date is the same as the hospice revocation date See C7010 Claim Submission Error Help article for more information.

Should I bill the hospice, traditional Medicare, or the MA plan? Federal regulations require that Medicare administrative contractors (MAC) maintain payment responsibility for managed care enrollees who elect hospice. While a hospice election is in effect, certain types of claims may be submitted to the MAC by either the hospice provider or a provider treating an illness not related to the terminal condition.

      "content": "Palmetto GBA Audit team members from JJ and JM jurisdictions held a Wage Index update webinar on August 21, 2023. Providers may watch the on-demand version of the webinar here: Jurisdictions J and M Wage Index Updates and Review Webinar . You may share this information with coworkers or refresh your knowledge. The frequently asked questions below were asked during the event. We are sharing the answers in case other have the same questions. Question Response Will this be recorded so we can refer to later? Yes. Here is the link: Jurisdiction J and M Wage Index Updates and Review Webinar . Where on CMS.gov can we find wage index files and information? Wage Index Files What happens in the event that we only have invoices and not a contract to support patient related contract labor? The minimum required supporting documentation for contract labor is the contract itself. The MAC must have valid contracts on file in order to allow the contract labor. For the contract labor log, is the W//S A cost center data field the same as the cost report line number? Yes, the cost center would refer to the worksheet A \"cost center\" line that the costs are filed on. Does the MAC really want all of a hospital's contracts? This could be hundreds of contracts, especially with the home office allocations? The minimum required supporting documentation for contract labor is the contract itself. The MAC must have valid contracts on file in order to allow the contract labor. PHE, which most of these are under, had to only have two weeks within a year? The covid related reminder that was sent last year still applies to a very small portion of this wage index review period. If providers need a copy of this covid related reminder, please email JJWageIndex@palmettogba.com (JJ providers) or Costreport.WageIndex@palmettogba.com (JM providers). When determining the invoice dates outside the cost reporting period for contract labor, it is based off the actual date on the invoice, correct? Not when it was paid? For example, there is an invoice dated 12/31/20 with a net 30 due date. It's paid by the provider in January 2021. That's excluded on 2021 cost report but allowed on the 2020 cost report? For a provider with a 12/31 FY. The cost report is on a GAAP/accrual basis and contract labor should be reported in the period performed. A slide indicated that Phys Part A must not be in a general service cost center. Can you provide the regulatory citation for this? There is no specific regulatory citation. Palmetto/CMS views Physician Part A services in \"General Service Cost Centers\" as non-allowable since the services only benefit the general patient population. If a cost report has already been NPR'd, are they still subject to the Wage Index Review? Yes the wage index review is performed outside of the desk review process. Therefore, if the FYE falls within CMS's review period for wage index, it will be reviewed. If material adjustments are made during wage index we would reopen the report to incorporate those wage index adjustments. For providers who have hundreds of contracts due to the volume of their contract labor and size of the hospital system, it is a burden to provide all contracts for every vendor. Can you please provide an explanation for needing every contract? Could we just supply the sample selected? The minimum required supporting documentation for contract labor is the contract itself. The MAC must have valid contracts on file in order to allow the contract labor. If filing an amended cost report to document Wage Index changes, how far in advance of the 9/1 deadline does it need to be filed? Amended cost reports can take up to 30 days to be accepted. Our acceptance team will work diligently to accept any wage amendments as quickly as possible, but it cannot be guaranteed to be accepted within 30 days of the wage correction deadline. Please reach out to your contract's wage coordinator if you plan to submit an amended report for wage changes. JJWageIndex@palmettogba.com (JJ providers) or Costreport.WageIndex@palmettogba.com (JM providers). From Line 40: What level of detail is expected to be provided in the TPA report? The MAC should be able to ascertain that the TPA report came directly from the third-party administrator, and the report should be broken down at a provider/CCN level of claims detail. What do I need to do if I did not receive a documentation request letter? Also, will we get a copy of the audio of this webinar? Please email JJWageIndex@palmettogba.com (JJ providers) or Costreport.WageIndex@palmettogba.com (JM providers) with any inquires. Please also email these boxes if a provider contact has changed and needs to be updated for our wage index records. After 9/1 deadline how soon will providers be notified of additional request subject to the two-day deadline? Palmetto strives to get initial follow-up requests to providers within three four weeks of the project begin date. There will always be requests throughout our 10 week process, however (samples pulled, additional issues noted or questions that arise during reviews, etc). An invoice is proof of cost and payment, why is this not considered sufficient? The minimum required supporting documentation for contract labor is the contract itself. The MAC must have valid contracts on file in order to allow the contract labor. Have there been any discussions across the MACs in regard to contract labor? Palmetto GBA has taken a far more aggressive stance regarding contract language and application of adjustments. This penalizes hospitals audited by Palmetto GBA vs other MACs. MACs meet regularly together to discuss CMS requirements and interpretations of regulations, including but not limited to wage index updates. Palmetto strives to conduct reviews in a similar manner to all other MACs. It is noted that CMS scrutiny of contract labor has increased in recent years. Is Contract Labor (Lines 11; 12; 13; 28) reported on the cash bases of accounting? Services occurred during the fiscal year and actual payment occurred after the end of fiscal year. Include in year of service or year of payment. The cost report is on a GAAP/accrual basis and contract labor should be reported in the period performed. Is the contract labor listing template mandatory? The contract labor listing isn't required but is highly encouraged. We will need all the data contained within this template, so as long as that data is submitted, the format of that data isn't as important. Does the Provider have to transfer all their data to the contract labor listing templates? The contract labor listing isn't required but is highly encouraged. We will need all the data contained within this template, so as long as that data is submitted, the format of that data isn't as important. Do all contracts need to be submitted by 9/1 or can we submit once requested by an auditor? Yes. If the contracts have not been previously submitted and/or the contract is new in current year, the contract must be submitted by the initial requested deadline. Remember that if contracts were submitted in previous years or with the as-filed cost report, there is no need to resubmit these. Should we except to see audit adjustments before late November so we have an opportunity to review before HCRIS deadline at end of year? Our auditors will issue adjustments to providers as soon as our Round 1 reviews are completed. However, the provider has from mid-November 2023 until February 2024 to rebut any Round 1 adjustments that the MAC makes. Should all contract labor invoices be submitted at the time the information request is submitted? Yes. If the contracts have not been previously submitted and/or the contract is new in current year, the contract must be submitted. Remember that if contracts were submitted in previous years or with the as-filed cost report, there is no need to resubmit these. We haven't had to submit all contract labor contracts in the past. Is this being newly enforced this year? This has been a requirement for Palmetto for the past five plus years. It has been part of our information request out to providers each year and we send these information requests typically a month before wage index reviews begin. It is noted that CMS has increased scrutiny of our contract labor reviews in recent years. Was the Covid19reminder.docx not issued this year with the documentation requests? The covid related reminder that was sent last year still applies to a very small portion of this wage index review period. If providers need a copy of this covid related reminder, please email JJWageIndex@palmettogba.com (JJ providers) or Costreport.WageIndex@palmettogba.com (JM providers). Is it either submit contracts or receive invoice selection? The minimum required supporting documentation for contract labor is the contract itself. The MAC must have valid contracts on file in order to allow the contract labor. If a contract is not submitted by 9/1, will the cost be thrown out, or can we provide the contract after 9/1? JJ and JM requested in July 2023, that all supporting contracts be submitted by September 1, 2023 (if not previously submitted). If we do not have contracts in house by 9/1, we will review to determine allowability and may possibly make additional information requests. Palmetto reminded providers with the July request that any additional information requests after 9/1 would not allow providers much time for response. If we have to request after 9/1 we will likely allow providers two to three days to respond, otherwise the costs will be written off. Providers will have until February 2024 to rebut any findings that the MAC determines during Round 1 of wage index reviews. Some health systems have several hundred contract labor vendor contracts. How can we submit hundreds of contracts through eServices? The provider may email them in a zip file to our wage index email boxes as well if this is easier. JJWageIndex@palmettogba.com (JJ providers) or Costreport.WageIndex@palmettogba.com (JM providers). Keep in mind that if contracts were submitted in previous years or with as-filed cost report information, they do not need to be resubmitted again. Are contracts only for S-3 Line 11? A valid contract must be in force by the provider, for any contract labor claimed on the wage index worksheets. Why would the auditor ask for all contracts and not just for the vendor being sampled? The minimum required supporting documentation for contract labor is the contract itself. The MAC must have valid contracts on file in order to allow the contract labor. For intermittent labor purchased, not every service has a contract...but does have an approved purchase order between the third party vendor and the hospital? Purchased orders do not constitute a valid contract. For any contract labor claimed there must be a valid signed contract on file with the facility. If there was no issue with a Contract Labor contract in PY, do you still have to send the contract for this year? Yes. If the contracts have not been previously submitted and/or the contract is new in current year, the contract must be submitted. Remember that if contracts were submitted in previous years or with the as-filed cost report, there is no need to resubmit these. Would an engagement letter from a consulting firm (example, financial statement audit firm) that shows total dollars, but not average hourly wage, would that be an acceptable contract? If the document is signed by both parties, contains all contract terms, including cost information and time to be spent performing the contract, we would likely accept that as a \"contract\" it just depends on if the document contains all required aspects of a typical contract. The MAC must be able to determine actual labor costs paid and actual labor hours worked. What if the contracts are included in the as filed cost report? The MAC auditors should have access to any information submitted with the as-filed cost report. This information does not need to be resubmitted during wage reviews. Are contracts required for every contract area, including contract nursing? Yes any contract labor claimed must have a valid signed contract submitted to be allowed. In the past CMS had \"Contract Labor\" reviewed every three years unless they exceeded the threshold. Are you telling us Contract labor is now being reviewed every year? CMS thresholds are internal and not public to the providers. However, MACs will review on the CMS determined schedule and MAC can confirm that CMS scrutiny of contract labor has increased in recent years. Providers have strong incentives to pay according to the contract, so you can rest assured that the provider is paying per contract. I know this will not change the requirement but wanted to mention this. The MAC will work to review and determine actual labor costs paid and actual labor hours worked. The amounts paid should be in agreement with the written contract in force during the period. Engagement letters are signed by both parties. Would this be acceptable as a contract? If the document is signed by both parties, contains all contract terms, including cost information and time to be spent performing the contract, we would likely accept that as a \"contract\" it just depends on if the document contains all required aspects of a typical contract. If an invoice has a different amount than the contract, is the entire amount disallowed or only partial? The MAC will work to review and determine actual labor costs paid and actual labor hours worked. The amounts paid should be in agreement with the written contract in force during the period. Contract Labor: Include in the year service was performed or service was paid? The cost report is on a GAAP/accrual basis and contract labor should be reported in the period performed. Are you saying if the invoice amount exceeds the contract amount you will accept the contracted amount on the listing? The MAC will work to review and determine actual labor costs paid and actual labor hours worked. The amounts paid should be in agreement with the written contract in force during the period. Issues were identified with Qualivis for contract labor on the last round. What is the expectation for documentation from this contractor? We have to be able to ensure that the document came directly from the vendor provider attestations are not acceptable. If the supporting documentation came from the vendor at a level that we need for review (signed contract, actual labor hours worked, actual labor costs paid), we would accept this information as support. So if we have 250 vendors and thousands of invoices, we need to submit 250 contracts? Yes, to claim contract labor costs, we do require the contracts to be submitted at a minimum. Keep in mind that if contracts were submitted during prior year reviews, you do not have to resubmit those contracts. For Qualivis: Are you saying excel workbook from Qualivis breaking down allowed vs. non-allowed is okay? We must be able to ensure that the document came directly from the vendor provider attestations are not acceptable. If the supporting documentation came from the vendor at a level that we need for review, we would accept this information as support. What if a contract does not state an AHW? The MAC must be able to determine that a signed contract was in place, and that actual labor hours worked, and actual labor costs paid are being claimed on the applicable wage index line. It's difficult for current staff to know what Contracts were submitted in prior years due to staff turnover at facilities. Is there a listing the MAC has as to what has been submitted in prior years? The MAC does not maintain a global listing of contacts already in-house but provider staff is welcome to reach out to JJWageIndex@palmettogba.com (JJ providers) or Costreport.WageIndex@palmettogba.com (JM providers) with specific inquiries as to contracts already received. A lot of our contracts don't have AHW, but the invoices have hours listed. Is that sufficient? The MAC must be able to determine that a signed contract was in place, and that actual labor hours worked, and actual labor costs paid are being claimed on the applicable wage index line. What is the minimum language required for Medical Director contracts? This is provider and contract specific. The MAC will review various criteria to determine if the costs are allowable. Any relevant contract information should be included (job duties, pay, requirements for bonuses, etc.). Does the contract labor log require the cost report line or GL cost center, for the cost center field? Yes, this is required. Do you have an example of a report from a vendor with \"all inclusive\" language in the contract that was sufficient support to allow the contract labor? If \"all inclusive\" rates are paid, these cannot be claimed on the wage index worksheet without a breakdown of labor only costs. CMS instructs providers to include only labor costs within the wage index. No supplies, travel, etc may be included.",

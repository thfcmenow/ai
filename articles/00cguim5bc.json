These reporting errors will be counted as an error in the review process and may cause service intensity add-on (SIA) payments to be applied incorrectly on the claim.&nbsp;</p><p>Hospices shall report visits and length of visits (rounded to the nearest 15-minute increment), for nurses, aides, social workers&nbsp;and therapists who are employed by the hospice, that occur on the date of death, after the patient has passed away, with modifier PM. The reporting of post-mortem visits, on the date of death, should occur regardless of the patient&rsquo;s level of care or site of service. Post-mortem visits occurring on a date subsequent to the date of death are not to be reported.</p><p>Date of death is defined as the date of death reported on the death certificate. Hospices shall report hospice visits that occur before death on a separate line from those which occur after death.</p><p>For example, assume that a nurse arrives at the home at 9 p.m. to provide routine home care (RHC) to a dying patient, and that the patient passes away at 11 p.m. The nurse stays with the family until 1:30 a.m. The hospice should report a nursing visit with eight 15-minute time units for the visit from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. On a separate line, the hospice should report a nursing visit with a PM modifier with four 15-minute time units for the portion of the visit from 11 p.m. to midnight to account for the 1 hour post mortem visit.</p><p>If the patient passes away suddenly, and the hospice nurse does not arrive until after his death at 11 p.m., and remains with the family until 1:30 a.m., then the hospice should report a line item nursing visit with a PM modifier and four 15-minute increments of time as the units to account for the 1 hour post mortem visit from 11 p.m. to midnight.</p><p><strong>Resource:</strong> Medicare Claims Processing Manual, <a href=\\\"https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/clm104c11.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Chapter 11 &mdash;&nbsp;Processing Hospice Claims</a>&nbsp;(PDF), section 30.3 &mdash;&nbsp;Data Required on the Institutional Claim to A/B MAC (HHH).</p>",
